## 📘 About This Repository

- All code in this repository corresponds directly to **Rosalind Bioinformatics Stronghold problems**.
- Every script has been **written manually from scratch** without using external references.
- The implementations **produce the expected outputs** when tested with Rosalind sample datasets.
- Some solutions may differ slightly from real-world biological expectations because they are optimized for Rosalind’s specific formats.

## 🤖 Note on AI Usage

To maintain full transparency:

### AI **was NOT used** for:
- Logic implementation  
- Algorithm design  
- Problem solving  
- Debugging  
- Coding the solutions themselves  

### AI **was used ONLY for**:
- Adding docstrings for clarity  
- Beautifying and aligning the code structure (formatting)

Docstring explanations may vary slightly in style because of this limited AI involvement.  
No other AI-generated logic or content appears in the solution scripts.
